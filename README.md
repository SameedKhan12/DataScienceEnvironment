# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem - Jupyter Notebook Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains my final assignment for the "Data Science Tools and Ecosystem" course. The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate basic proficiency with Jupyter Notebooks, including working with markdown cells, code cells, tables, lists, arithmetic expressions, and sharing work through GitHub.

## How to View the Notebook

1. You can view the notebook directly in GitHub using the file viewer.  
2. Alternatively, download the `.ipynb` file and open it with:  
   - [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)  
   - [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  
   - Anaconda or other Jupyter-compatible environments

## Notes

- The screenshots demonstrate each step as per the assignment requirements.  
- For markdown cells, only the visible content is captured (not the markdown syntax itself).  
- The notebook follows the structure and instructions provided in the course.
